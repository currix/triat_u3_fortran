Release notes for triat_u3_min 2.1 (notes compiled 2010/04/11)

 v. 2.1.0

 * Added test to check correct assignment of experimental levels 
   in the linear case. (Mod(n,2) = Mod(l,2)).

 * Added the possibility of predicting and comparing theoretical 
   energies with experimental values which are not included in the
   chi-2 calculation. 
   To do so, the experimental energy error should be fixed to zero.

 * Added program to compute general 1-2-3-4 body hamiltonian eigenvalues

                   -------------------------------------
 v. 2.2.0

 * Added program to compute general 1-2-3-4 body hamiltonian
   eigenvalues and eigenvectors and display components of
   the eigenstates in the U(2) and SO(3) basis.

 * The energies are displayed only once the fit has finished
   (IFLAG.eq.3) unless iprint.gt.0.

 * New version of the perl script launcher. More flexible with regard
   to the executable program definition.

 * Added programs to compute observables of interest in the 
   bosonic U(3) algebraic model.

   (1) expected_val_n :: 
       expected value of the number of tau bosons

   (2) intensity_IR :: 
       squared expected value of the transition operator between
       Hamiltonian eigenstates.



                   -------------------------------------
 v. 2.2.1

   (1) Bug in minuit_U3_genH corrected. Default path of statically
   compiled binary.

   (2) Added option to compute the expected value of the number of 
   tau bosons for the eigenstates of a given Hamiltonian and display the 
   result as a function of the number of quanta, normalized by N or not.

   (3) Added a perl script to produce the necessary output to build 
   excitation energy diagrams.

   (4) Added the source file of minuit not to require the cernlib
   package (absent in squeeze). Now the compilation can be done
   without reference to the minuit libraries.

   (5) Added default rules for f90 files in makefile. 

   (6) Change of the atlas path to the new path of the library in
   squeeze. Only required if compiling statically. Checked in Lenny
   and Squeeze Debian distributions.

   (7) Tridiagonal matrix diagonalization of the model Hamiltonian
   energies. N_max = 40000.

   (8) Added Perl script alg_U3_energy to compute U(3) model energies.

   (9) Possibility of showing an experimental level without including
   it in the fit. Indicated with one extra data column in experimental
   data with flag or 0.0 error value.


                   -------------------------------------
 
v. 2.2.2

   (1) In the tri_min_T fitting procedure only eigenvectors that
   correspond to levels with experimental information are
   unambiguously assigned. Only exception for in the last minuit
   iteration (minuit iflag = 3) and if all eigenvectors or eigenstates
   have to be printed (iprint > 0).

   (2) Added the possibility of saving eigenvalues and eigenstates in the 
   model Hamiltonian case (program avec_U3_mh).
 
   (3) Alternative assignment of levels with minimum energy difference
   instead of with quantum labels. New column in experimental
   data. (---TO DO---)
